What is this?
=============

This a simple class to help you read large TSV based files into NSArrays. This projects contains unit tests and sample tsv file.


How good is this?
-----------------

I've made this project while being asked to perform a technical test for one of my job interviews. It is in no way the best approach to manipulate large files, however sturdy enough to be used in simple applications.

*Watch out for //TODO and other tags. Some fixes may be required for your particular task*

Can it parse CSV files too?
---------------------------

Although you can find and set the separator character in the header of the class I would not recommend it, since this parses has no logic for processing multiple commas or quotation marks. Yet again, this was just a technical test, but since I've got the working code done I though it might be useful for someone else as a pod.
